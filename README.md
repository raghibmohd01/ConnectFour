# ConnectFour
During my training at Internshala, I developed a version of the classic game, Connect Four.

Connect Four is a strategic two-player game where each participant selects a color and alternately drops colored discs into a vertically suspended grid with seven columns and six rows. The discs fall straight down, filling the lowest available slot in the chosen column. The primary goal of the game is to be the first player to align four of their discs in a rowâ€”horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
